			Bengali Bhetki Macher Paturi Recipe is Bengali Style Barramundi Fish cooked by wrapping in banana leaf. The bhetki fish pieces are marinated in a spiced mustard paste, wrapped in banana leaf individually and then slow cooked till tender. The word "Paturi" means leaf, in Bengali. Generally we Bengalis make paturi using  Ilish (hilsa fish), Bhetki (Barramundi fish) and chingri (prawn). This is a delicious recipe with the bhetki fish. Try savouring this Bengali Bhetki Macher Paturi Recipe (Barramundi Fish Wrapped in Banana Leaf) along with plain steamed rice, or Pudina Rice Recipe (Spicy Mint Pulao), along with Bengali Style Cholar Dal Recipe and Sweet and Spicy Tomato Chutney Recipe.

			Calcutta biryani is distinguished by its yellow-coloured rice which is soaked in saffron and kewra water and, no matter what people tell you, it can not be simply described as a version of the Awadhi biryani. Containing meat cooked in yoghurt, this biryani is full of potatoes and boiled eggs, along with a touch of sweetness thanks to cinnamon and nutmeg.
			Legend has it that since during the Bengal famine meat was scarce, the Nawab decreed that potatoes would be used in biryani instead. Others suggest he simply liked the flavour of potatoes. Some even say that only the poor used potatoes and it became popular. Regardless of the reason, that practice continues today and sets this biryani apart.

			Rasgulla is an Indian syrupy dessert popular in the Indian subcontinent and regions with South Asian diaspora. It is made from ball-shaped dumplings of chhena (an Indian cottage cheese) and semolina dough, cooked in light syrup made of sugar. This is done until the syrup permeates the dumplings. The dish originated in East India; the present-day states of Odisha and West Bengal have variously claimed to be its birthplace.
			To prepare rasgulla, the cheese (chhena) mixture is formed into small balls. These balls are then simmered in a sugar syrup. It can also be prepared using a pressure cooker or an oven. While serving add a drop of rose water (only organic and edible type of rose water, not rose perfume or synthetic flavors) to enhance the flavor and taste.
